  - Mix by hand to combine.
  - Shape into small balls the size of apricots

  - Cook until browned on all sides.
  - Transfer to a plate and cook the other meatballs.
  - Finish the meatballs in the [tomato sauce](tartine-tomato-sauce)
  - Serve with pasta, or in a [meatball sub](tartine-meatball-sub).

comment:
  - "Good flavor, although they were a bit tricky to keep intact when frying.  Suggest making sure the onions are finely diced&mdash; they were a bit more a medium or lazy dice, possibly creating fissure points (although David Lebovitz's pictures looked similar)."
  - "David Lebovitz bakes 15 minutes in the oven at 350 &deg;F rather than frying."
corrections:
  - "Added garlic, from the recommendation of [David Lebovitz](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/meatball-sandwich-submarine-grinder-hoagie-torpedo/)."
