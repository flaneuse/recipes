recipeIngredient:
  - "&frac12; oz. dried wild mushrooms"
  - "3 &frac12; cups mushrooms, finely chopped (~ 12 oz.)"
  - 3 shallots, minced
  - 2 garlic cloves, crushed
  - squeeze of lemon juice
  - 6 large sage leaves, finely chopped
  - "5 &frac12; tablespoons butter"
  - whole chicken
recipeInstructions:
  - Pour boiling water over the wild mushrooms to rehydrate.  Soak for 30 minutes, drain, and chop.
  - "Preheat the oven to 350 &deg;F."
  - Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan and saut√© the mushrooms until golden brown and dry.
  - Add the wild mushrooms (and optionally the shallots or yellow onion too) and let cook for a few minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.
  - Let the mushrooms cool to room temperature.
  - Add a squeeze of lemon juice, the shallots, garlic, and the sage.
  - Mix the mushrooms with the rest of the butter and cool in the fridge to resolidify.
  - Clean the chicken and loosen the skin under the breast and legs; be careful not to tear.
  - Add the cold mushroom/butter mixture under the skin of the chicken.  Replace the top skin as much as possible.
  - Season the outside of the bird with salt and pepper.
  - Roast for ~ 1 hour until the thickest part of the thigh reaches 165 &deg;F.  Baste the chicken every once in awhile with the pan juices.
  - Remove the chicken and rest for 10 minutes under aluminum foil before serving.
comment:
  - Start prepping the mushrooms early, to give them time to soak, cook, cool, and the butter to resolidify.
  - Fresh sage flavor is strong; not my favorite flavor profile.
  - The mushrooms under the skin are also a bit fiddly to eat.  Unclear how much they flavored the chicken.
