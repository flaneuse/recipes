* 1 eggplant
* ~ 3-4 tomatoes (or canned)
* 1 onion/shallots
* 3-4 cloves garlic
* 1 chili (Thai or similar)
* 1/4 t. paprika
* sprinkle of cayenne pepper
* 1/2 t. turmeric
* 1 t. ginger (powdered, but fresh might be better)

1. Roast eggplant slices, drizzled in oil, for 20-30 min. at 350 deg F. Flip halfway through; eggplant should be soft but not mushy.
2. Meanwhile, saute onion till soft.
3. Add garlic and spices and cook for ~ 30 s.
4. Add tomatoes and cook till soft.
5. Remove to a food processor and blitz till smooth.
6. Remove eggplant from oven, and layer slices with tomato sauce to make a casserole / lasagna of sorts.
7. Bake in oven for ~ 20 min. to meld flavors together.
