recipeIngredient:
- "300 g (3 &#8531; cups) rolled oats"
- "80 g (scant &frac34; cup) oat flour"
- "70 g (&#8531; cup + 1 tablespoon) dark brown sugar"
- 1 teaspoon salt
- "&frac12; teaspoon baking soda"
- "170 g (&frac34; cup) unsalted butter, cold"
- 3 tablespoon (45 ml) milk
- 1 teaspoon molasses
- (optional) chocolate (milk or dark) for dipping
recipeInstructions:
  - "Preheat the oven to 350 &deg;F."
  - Prepare the homemade oat flour by blitzing the rolled oats in a food processor or spice grinder till finely ground.
  - Mix the homemade oat flour with the commercially ground oat flour, brow sugar, salt, and baking soda.
  - "Cut the butter into &frac14; inch cubes and add to the oat mixture. Process in the food processor till sandy, or cut the butter into the oats using a pastry blender till the mixture is sandy."
  - Mix the molasses and milk together and add to the oats.  Combine till the dough starts to come together.
  - Knead a couple times until the dough is cohesive.
  - Form the dough into balls and flatten till &frac14; inch thick.  Tartine recommends 1 tablespoon of dough, but I prefer ~ 30 g dough balls.  Make sure they're thin enough, since they won't expand when they bake.
  - "Bake ~ 14 minutes at 350 &deg;F, rotating halfway through, until the edges and bottom are golden brown."
  - Cool on the baking sheet ~ 5 minutes until set and migrate to a wire rack.
  - If you're coating with chocolate, carefully melt the chocolate over a double boiler or in a microwave to melt.  If you're feeling fancy, tempur the chocolate to ensure a glossy shine and good snap.  Coat the cooled cookies with chocolate.
comment:
  - Since I couldn't find oat flour, I used all oats that had been blitzed in the food processor.  Still tasty, but perhaps a bit more rustic than the original.
  - Be sure to flatten them properly!  They don't expand as cooking, so they should be close to their final thickness.
  -  First batch was a touch on the salty side; might want to reduce next time (assuming I measured the salt properly...).
