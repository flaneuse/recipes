Based roughly on [Tartine's protocol](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016277-tartines-country-bread?gclid=CjwKCAjwwMn1BRAUEiwAZ_jnElAPYBgFoQUKRyj5ea2wf2YfIwIuDzk_S-SD_m7fyQBwLypVm_5FphoCpxEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), [Serious Eats Sourdough Pizza](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/12/starter-along-sourdough-pizza.html)

1. Day 1: 100 g warm water (80 deg F) and 100 g 1:1 whole wheat:bread flour. Mix and cover with tea towel.
2. Day 2: starter already looked active / smelled funky, so went ahead with a 50 g water, 50 g flour mix feeding after removing ~ 70-80%. Seemed to respond well; aerated and rose.
3. Day 3: 50 g water, 50 g flour feedings each morning.  Seemed to be pretty quiescent; mildly acidic smelling but not super active. In the mornings, would smell pretty acidic / cheesy.
4. Days 4-7 : switched to 75 g water, 75 g flour feedings; was worried starter was exhausting food supply. (day 6- switched to a new clean vial)
5. Day 8: starting to look good after feeding! Lots of tiny bubbles throughout, and after feeding, within 1-2 h predictably rises, and then hours later begins to fall. Tends to smell like sour beer; mildly acidic and yeast/floury. Very different from initial Serious Eats-based starter, which I think went too far into post-log-phase growth and had separated into alcohol and runny flour goop, and was strongly sour/cheesy/unpleasant smelling.
6. Day 9: fed again with 75 g water/flour. Good predictable behavior for the rise.
7. Day 10:
* first harvest: removed 4 oz. of starter + 2 oz. flour + 1 oz. water at 80 deg F. Let rise at RT covered for 12 h; tested leven by seeing if it floats in water.
* after 12 h rise: 8 0z. flour + 5 oz. water; knead till ball, 3 min. Add 1 t. NaCl, 1.5 tb olive oil and knead at low speed additional 10 min. till elastic. Store 2xON in fridge in oiled plastic bag.
* rest of the starter: added 75 g each to continue its rise.
8. Day 11: feed again with 100 g. water/flour, then refrigerate. If super active ON, feed again and stir and leave in fridge.
9. To revive: take ~ 1 tb. and feed again with 75 g ea. at RT till rises predictably.
