recipeIngredient:
  - 255 g (2 cups) flour
  - 1 tablespoon baking powder
  - "100 g (&frac12; cup) granulated sugar"
  - "&frac34; teaspoon salt"
  - 1 stick (115 g) cold unsalted butter
  - 1 cup frozen cherries (halved), peaches (bite-sized), or berries
  - "&frac12; cup (120 ml) sour cream or Greek yogurt"
  - "&frac14; cup milk (preferably whole)"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Preheat the oven to 400 &deg;F (Note: 350 &deg;F seems fine too)."
  - Mix the dry ingredients together.
  - Cut the butter into the flour until the crumbs are pea-sized.
  - Mix the milk and sour cream with the berries and gently mix by hand until you have a shaggy dough.  Be careful not to overmix.  It may be necessary to add a bit more milk, but be careful not to add too much moisture, since the frozen fruit will give off liquid as it warms up.
  - Pat the dough into a ~ 1" thick rectangle and cut into pieces.
  - Sprinkle the dough with demerra sugar and bake until just golden brown around the edges.
comment:
  - Be careful not to add too much liquid; as the frozen fruit melts, it adds moisture, turning the dough sticky. The result is an unpleasant chew to the edges of the dough.
  - Reduce the sugar next time.  Suggest 50-75 g sugar / 200 g flour based on [Judy Rodgers Scones]() and [Tartine Buttermilk Scones]()
  - Suggest trying adding lamination suggested in Tartine no. 3.
corrections:
  - Reduce the sugar. It's sweet enough with the cherries.
