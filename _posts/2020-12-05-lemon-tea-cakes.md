recipeIngredient:
  - 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter (room temperature)
  - 1 large egg (room temperature)
  - zest of 1 medium lemon
  - 1 - 3 teaspoons lemon juice
  - "1 &frac12; cups all-purpose flour"
  - "&frac14; teaspoon kosher salt"
  - "&frac14; teaspoon baking soda"
  - "&frac34; cup granulated sugar"
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
recipeInstructions:
  - Warm the butter and egg to room temperature.
  - Cream the butter and sugar together till light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes.
  - Add the lemon juice, zest, vanilla, egg, and combine.
  - Mix the flour, baking soda, and salt and add to the butter mixture on low.
  - Refrigerate 1-3 hours till firm.
  - 'Roll into balls, roll with granulated sugar, and flatten. Note: the recipe says "flatten slightly", but they do not spread much during baking.  Flatten a bit more than "slightly".'
  - "Bake at 325 &deg;F for 9 - 11 minutes till golden on the edges."
comment:
  - "Better w/ European butter?  A bit on the bland side&mdash; they were either not buttery, lemony, and/or sugary enough."
  - Next time try the full 3 t. lemon.
  - Don't spread much when they bake.  Make sure to flatten well.
corrections:
  - Added more lemon juice.
  - Rolled with granulated sugar before baking.
