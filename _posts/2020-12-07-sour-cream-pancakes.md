recipeIngredient:
  - 1 egg, separated (or not)
  - "&frac12; cup sour cream"
  - "&#8531; cup milk"
  - 2 tablespoons melted butter, cooled
  - "&frac34; cup flour"
  - 1 tablespoon sugar
  - 1 teaspoon baking powder
  - "&frac12; teaspoon salt"

recipeInstructions:
  - "Mix the egg yolk (or whole egg), sugar, sour cream, and milk together. (Note: most of the times I'm lazy and just add the whole egg, skipping folding in the egg whites)."
  - Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt together and mix with the wet ingredients.  Do not overmix.
  - Add in the melted butter.
  - Beat the egg white till soft peaks form.  Fold gently into the batter; again, a little bit imperfectly mixed is better than overmixing and developing gluten which will make the pancakes tough.
  - Cook on a griddle or frying pan, using extra butter as needed to prevent sticking.
comment:
  - Plain Greek yogurt can be substituted for the sour cream.
corrections:
  - Decreased sugar from the original recipe.  Too sweet!
  - Usually, use whole eggs rather than messing with folding in egg white foam.
