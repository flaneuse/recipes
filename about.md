I'm a scientist who loves cooking, data visualization, and helping understand problems that affect human health one organized piece of data at a time.

There are few simple pleasures that make me happier than a new cookbook to explore; this site is my lab notebook of recipes I've tested, my opinions of them, and adjustments I've made along the way.
